.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I pmc
device serves a one-level directory, giving
access to the hardware counters on the
different cores. This counters can count events,
cycles or any unit of measure imagined by the designer
of the architecture.
There is a file per core,
.B coreNNNN,
containing the state of the active counters on
that core.
.PP
This file provide access to the value of the counters.
.PP
Any change to or from the counters or the configurations is seen
as soon as possible. In the worst case, it is guaranteed that the values
read or set are at least as fresh as the last time a process went in or out
of the kernel on that core.
.PP
The file contains a line per active counter. Each line has 7 fields separated by spaces.
The fields are:
.IP \-
The counter number (each core my have a number of counters).
.IP \-
The value of the counter.
.IP \-
The string
.B on.
.IP \-
A string describing whether it is counts only in user space, either
.B user
or
.B nouser.
.IP \-
A string describing whether it is counts only in kernel space, either
.B os
or
.B noos.
.IP \-
A string the configuration in a format recognized by this
driver. Readable versions of this string can be found in the file
.B ctrdesc.
.PP
A line similar to those obtained when reading can be written to the file to configure
the counters. The first two fields are mandatory, the rest are optional and may or may
not be present. If the number of the counter is -, the driver picks
an appropiate one or returns an error if there is not any free.
Any other field  with the value
.B -
is simply ignored.
